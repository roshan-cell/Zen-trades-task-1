Submission: JSON Data Parsing and Presentation

Work Done: Created an application to parse JSON data from the provided API, containing information about 1000 products, and presented the data based on decreasing popularity.

Tasks Completed in manner:

1. Fetching of JSON Data: Utilized JavaScript's fetch function to asynchronously fetch data from the API (https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-to-cors/assignment.json).
2. Data Storage: Parsed the JSON response and extracted the products array.
3. Sorting and Displaying: Created an array of product objects. Sorted the products based on descending popularity.
4. Data Presentation: Dynamically populated an HTML table with the sorted product information(descending manner). Used a try-catch block to handle errors during the fetch     operation.
5. The data in the presentation is oredered on the basis of descending 'popularity'.
